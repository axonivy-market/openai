 5$ are automatically added to it. This is perfect to develop your Chat GPT integration free of charge.

1. Register an account on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/overview).
2. Once logged in, click on your user icon on the upper right corner.
3. In the menu, use the "View API keys" option.
4. Generate a new API key and store it in your variables.yaml under `Variables.openai-connector.apiKey`

```
