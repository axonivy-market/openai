# ChatGPT Code Assistance

AI Context Assistance for all your code works within the Designer IDE. 

Helps you by:

- explaining code snippets
- fixing broken codes
- inserting new statements
- answering questions about your code

## Setup

Chat GPT requests do not come for free. However, when you register a new account,
 5$ are automatically added to it. This is perfect to develop your Chat GPT integration free of charge.

After installing this dropin-extension and rebooting the Designer:

1. Register an account on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/overview).
2. Once logged in, click on your user icon on the upper right corner.
3. In the menu, use the "View API keys" option.
4. Generate a new API key
5. Right click into a code editor: select `Chat GPT assistant` > `Set apiKey` > fill in your secret key.
